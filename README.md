# DSA

This repo provides basic code snippets helpful for the DSA lab. It also provides examples of how you should write your code.

You can check out the clean-code folder for examples of how you should write your code.

The code snippets that are helpful for each laboratory will be found in the respective folder. (e.g. lab1, lab2, etc.).
Those code snippets are also present on the website, [here](https://academy.codingshadows.com/docs/category/dsa).
